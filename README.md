# How to get data

With PhysioNet data access, you can create a database in bigquery and run the sql code (1_sql) there, changing the database name 'glucosedatabyicu' to whatever yours is, after that, run the python cohort code from 2_cohort, change the project ID to whatever yours is, and you will download the cohorted data that is used.

# MIMIC Access

MIMIC data can be found in PhysioNet, a repository of freely-available medical research data, managed by the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology. Due to its sensitive nature, credentialing is required to access both datasets.

Documentation for MIMIC-IV's can be found here: https://mimic.mit.edu/
